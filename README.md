A metadata-driven ingestion framework on Snowflake  leverages Snowflakeâ€™s native capabilities. The approach 
combines control tables, snow pipe,dynamic tables, tasks, and stored procedures to automate ingestion and 
transformation across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. The framework is designed to be flexible, 
scalable, and observable, providing data quality checks, CDC handling, and environment 
promotion while minimizing operational overhead.
